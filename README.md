# MapMaker
2d Game map editor.

**DISCLAIMER: -The assets used for the tiles are the same as the ones used in the game "Graal Online Classic"  
	      -The music used are also taken from different sources, I do not own any of the music used in this program.**
**This is a work in progress and no where near complete. I will update periodically**

**TO DO:**
1. work on menu state [Could use better graphics lol.]
2. Implement world saving to a text file [Can save the file, but needs to be able to choose file name and location its saved to.]
3. add tile selection menu [Finished with currently added tiles]
4. fix zooming issues. [Mainly fixed, also added limits]
5. add an undo option []
6. maybe add an option to make larger brush sizes [probably not, dont really see a reason too anymore]
7. ADD A BUNCH MORE TILES []
8. ADD A NEW WORLD OPTION TO CREATE NEW WORLDS []
	1. POTENTIAL PROCEDURAL GENERATION OPTION (so the world generates and grows as the user scrolls) []
	2. BIOME GENERATION []
	4. DIFFERENT DEFAULT SETTINGS SUCH AS - default grass world, different sized worlds etc. []
